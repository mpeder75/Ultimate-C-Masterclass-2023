/*
Define a HotelBooking class, which will contain the following fields that must be accessible outside of this class:
    • GuestName (string)
    • StartDate and EndDate (DateTimes)

The constructor of this class should take the following parameters (please maintain the given order and names):
    • guestName (string)
    • startDate (DateTime)
    • lengthOfStayInDays (int)

The constructor should set all fields of this class.

The EndDate should be calculated in the constructor as the StartDate plus the lengthOfStayInDays . 
You can use the AddDays method from the DateTime type to calculate it. 
You can do it right in the constructor body.
